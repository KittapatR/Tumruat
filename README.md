## Overview about the data
The data is extracted from Thailand police office database about crime rate since 2016-2019.

Although, filetype which is provided in the database is .pdf that is not easily to do directly. First, we convert the file into duplicable filetype (.docx) and combine it into excel file. Then, go to visualization via Tableau.
